Consumer Segmentation and Buying Behavior
Data preparation and exploratory analysis completed in Python and later imported to Tableau to visualize a meaningful story. Marketing data provided included consumer demographics, product categories, amount spent by each unique customer identifier, sales channel information, and promotion responses. From this data I was able to cluster customer segments by birth year (generations) to further analyze purchasing behaviors and sales channel preferences. After looking at the different trends I was able to conclude there was significant opportunity for the marketing team to capture the Millennial generation. Millennials, arguably the most 'tech savvy' generation has the least amount of website visits translated into sales on average. The website is the second most popular sales channel as well, so promotions to trigger more engagement on the website for Millennials can potential increase their reach to better capture that customer segment. Another piece of the analysis that should be considered by the marketing team is that the most lucrative product categories are the wine and meat products. On the other end of the spectrum, gold products could potentially be the most expensive to obtain but are bringing in the least amount of sales across all customer segments.
